subject: here I am creating a private repository and trying to access the repository with SSH keys
	note: I can simply access the repository with username and password also...but I choose to access it with SSH keys.
		So whenever I will try to access this github repo from this laptop, I don't have to use username and password
		for authenticating myself.

- git config --global user.name <your_name>
- git config --global user.email <dipayantah1234@gmail.com>
- touch .gitignore  
	- creates a empty file called .gitignore where you can store the names of files or folders that you don't want to upload to git
	- example to exclude the node_modules folder from uploading to git
		- node_modules/
- git init
	- initialises git and creates a .git file
- git add .
	- it creates a staging area for the project
- git commit -m "initial commit"
	- creates a commit
- git status
	- this command is not mandatory to run at this point
	- this shows the current status of the project for uploading on git
- git remote add origin <url of github repo>
	- this creates a link from the system where you are running the command and the "url of github repo"
- git push origin master
	- this will actually push the project into your github repo

GENERATING A PUBLIC KEY ON YOUR COMPUTER
-------------------------------------------
- ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email_on_github.ac@example.com"
	- generate a "ed25519" algorithm public key
- ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email_on_github.ac@example.com"
	- generate a "rsa" algorithm public key
- cat <path where key is created..example../c/Users/Ayan/.ssh/id_rsa.pub>
	- this displays the created keys on the windows
- go to this link, "https://github.com/settings/keys"
	- click on add new ssh key
	- copy the keys and paste here, give a title, then click on "Add.." button

AGAIN TO ADD FOR THE NEXT TIME
-------------------------------
- git add .
- git commit -m "................."
- git push origin master

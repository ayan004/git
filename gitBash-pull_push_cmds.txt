Note: Before pushing, you should always pull

STEPS TO PULL
---------------

- first check the git status
	- git status
- add which folder you want to push [here I want to push only the 'src' folder]
	- git add src
- write valid comment [currently I am creating the user update form]
	- git commit -m "user update form in progress"
- before pushing you should pull the current codes [here I am taking the pull from the developement folder]
	- git pull origin developement
- now you can push [here I am pushing in the developement folder]
	- git push origin developement
